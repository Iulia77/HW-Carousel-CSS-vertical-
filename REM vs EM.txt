Difference between REM & EM.

EM and REM are the same only EM not relative to HTML root.
For ex. if we set the font-size in EM it related to EM-parent.
If the parent has the font-size 10px and we put to the child 2.5em --it will be 25px.

If we put one REM it relative to HTML element (that means 16px, which browser use by default).
